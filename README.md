# Email Signature Generator

> :alembic: **Experimental** Test project for generating email signature using templates.

The aim for this project is to provide a simple web application to generate an email signature based on a template.
The key features to develop are:
* automatically encode in base64 images uploaded (company logo or profile picture)
* allow an admin to setup default templates the users can choose from
* allow a connection to LDAP server(s):
    * to secure the app (only allow authenticated users to generate signature)
    * retrieve automatically the personal information from the LDAP (admin could define the fields mapping)
    * allow the user to save in their LDAP profile the personal information they entered in the form
* allow multiple file formats for input and output (text only, HTML, Markdown)
* add a Visit Card generator and PDF export


For reference, the concept is similar to the following websites though our aim is to provide a simple solution to host privately:
* https://webapp.wisestamp.com/
* https://mysignature.io/editor
* https://www.hubspot.fr/email-signature-generator
